# Sprint Stories

A Ruby on Rails project built for Flatiron School by @imjoshellis

## About

Sprint Stories is an app for basic project management using Agile methodology. You can have multiple projects, each with their own goals and sprints.

Each sprint can have multiple goals and stories along with a start and end date. Stories can be categorized by their status, whether todo, doing, or closed.

The reason I chose to build a project management app is becuase I wanted to build something compareable to real world products.

## Demo

There is no live version of this currently, but here is a video walking through the product: [Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/c66cacd021344463a63ae1c99df48fb9)

If you'd like to demo the product, you can clone the repository, then run `bundle` to install gems, `rake db:migrate` to set up the database, `rake db:seed` (optional) if you want to seed the db with data, and `rails s` to start the server.
