# Simple Stories

A Ruby on Rails project built for Flatiron School by @imjoshellis

## About

Simple Stories is an app for basic project management using Agile methodology. You can have multiple projects, each with their own goals and sprints.

Each sprint can have multiple goals and stories along with a start and end date. Stories can be categorized by their status, whether todo, doing, or closed.

The reason I chose to build a project management app is becuase I wanted to build something compareable to real world products.
